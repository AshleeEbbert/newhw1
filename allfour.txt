Through this analysis, we learn that the mean number of boxes that a consumer must purchase to complete a collection of toys is, in general, higher when the probabilities of each toy in the purchased cereal box are different. The confidence interval produced is on average, (7.5, 9). So, we are 95% confident that the true mean number of cereal boxes needed to complete a set of 4 toys is generally between (7.5, 9). 

I created a function that performs a simulation which repeats for the specified sample size. It simulates the actions of a person, one at a time, buying a cereal box and receiving a random toy. The function keeps track of which toys the person has not yet received, ending the simulation for that person when they have all 4 and then storing the number of times the simulation had to repeat for that person until the simulation has been performed for the specified sample size. The function then calculates the average number of cereal boxes that had to be purchased in order for the person to receive all 4 toys. The function also calculates the proportion of customers who had to purchase 14 or more boxes to complete a se. Finally, I calculated a 95% confidence interval.
